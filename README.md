# Mathematical Functions

A few C++ programs for computing mathematical functions. These programs are tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and compiled using `g++` with C++14 unless stated otherwise.

## Unsolved inequality

The following inequality resulted from [Waring's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waring%27s_problem).

Paraphrased from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions#Unsolved_problem):

> Are there any positive integers *k* â‰¥ 6 such that:

> ![`3^{k}-2^{k}\left\lfloor \left({\tfrac {3}{2}}\right)^{k}\right\rfloor >2^{k}-\left\lfloor \left({\tfrac {3}{2}}\right)^{k}\right\rfloor -2`](equations/unsolved-inequality.png)

> Mahler proved there can only be a finite number of *k*; none are known.

From Wikipedia's page on Waring's problem, any solution to *k* would be larger than 471,600,600. It is conjectured, but not proven, that no such *k* exist.

I have been unable to find a name for this inequality. From what I have been able to find, it is **not** called Waring's problem, but is instead a result *of* Waring's problem.
